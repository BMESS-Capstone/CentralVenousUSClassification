# cvClassification

This code was adapated from the paper: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02248-2 from their Github repository found at https://github.com/VASST/AIVascularSegmentation 

Their code was heavily based on the well-known architecture found at this repository: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN
